    <description>For all Apex Classes or Methods, use this setting to bypass the execution of that logic. Create a new Apex Class Bypass record with the name of the apex class or method you wish to identify. Marking the &apos;Bypass&apos; checkbox on that record as TRUE will prevent that logic from executing. All classes not identified by Apex Class Bypass records or those where &apos;Bypass&apos; is marked as FALSE, will execute normally.</description>
